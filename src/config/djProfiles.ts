      "He discovered 'Hard House' not by mistake but by an opportunity presenting itself to him and the universe gracing him with the sound that ultimately would never leave his side. From the age of 16, Jonni, had purchased his first pair of turntables. He had discovered pioneers within the industry that set him off on a path of self-discovery. At the age of 17 he experienced great loss through suicide and cancer, and with this loss he leaned on 'Hard House' to move forward with his life, and it then began to create opportunities within his adolescent life, that would change his life forever.",
      'With events such as Sundissential, Polysexual, Godskitchen, Insomniacz and Progress from 2000, this propelled him forward to wanting to influence future generations through having these experiences. This led him onto attaining regular residency spots at events across the UK and Europe.',
      'The Passion and drive instilled through this musical influence in his life has led him to starting his own brand, and further his production skills.',
      'The vision is simple, to share my passion and love for electronic dance music to bring people together, and to create a unique sound and long-lasting memories.',

      "Chris fell upon the harder sound in around the year 2001 when commercial trance style tunes just didn't cut it! ",
      "Sundissential then became the norm...and it defined him!  In 2002 he began dj'ing and whilst serving away mastered his craft. In 2004 he started to poke into the Birmingham based circuit and featured in afters parties such as Shaft & Shine.",
      'The most notable and probably greatest achievement was playing alongside artists such as 12 inch thumpers, Ian M, Rafferty & Kershaw for Sundissential vs Afters!',
      'The years that followed were littered with private and personal gigs in Germany mainly, but the love for the sound never faltered!',
      'Now with a wisdom of understanding and a desire to keep the flame burning for our sound, Chris hopes to re-ignite the musical memory paths that you have embedded in your brain, to bring smiles and good times back to life.',

      'Hailing from Coventry, DJ Josh B is our newest member of the TTLF Family.',
      "Josh B purchased his first set of decks back in the year 2000 aged just 17! After 1 year of being a bedroom DJ, he secured his first weekly residency at Coventry's first hard house after club, the legendary 'FIDGET'.",
      "From there Josh soon began his own monthly night called 'Satisfaction' which ran up until 2003. Josh then decided it was time to take his DJ skills to the wider international audience and secured a residency in 'STAR BEACH', Malia Greece, before moving to Leeds in the same year.",
      "Josh currently lives back in Coventry and up until recently has been on pirate radio stations all across the Midlands but is hungry to bring back the days when he played at huge 'hard house' party's such as Sundissential North, B2t, Fidget and Crazy Daisy's to name but a few!",
      'Josh B prides himself on his friendly but high energy performances on the decks whilst always playing 1 or 2 rare tunes that you may not of heard before!',

  'Phil Wilson': {
    nickname: 'Fil-EP',
    content: [
      "Born in the 80s raised in the 90s by modest folk from Birmingham, FiL-EP began his love affair with dance music when his family pulled together enough sheckles to buy the poor young boy a copy of the Prodigy's Experience album. After listening to this constantly day and night, at full blast and to the annoyance of everyone, there was no surprise he developed a taste for Hard House and Hard Dance in general.",
      'In the early noughties raving hard on the Sundissential dance floor, giving big sweaty hugs to everyone üòâ he realised the one thing missing in his life was a set of decks. After spending many years perfecting some skill he managed to blag a gig on the pirate (at the time) radio station Mix FM with Birmingham based legends like DJ Wisk and Tony Moretti. FiL-EP had moved on from Hard House and Hard Dance by this time preferring Garage House, Deep House and Drum and Bass. ',
      "After a year of spinning tracks on Mix FM the young DJ decided to dabble in promoting putting events (not always music related) on at various venues including Subway City Birmingham this was too much work and he couldn't be arsed with it so he lost interest and decided to try a new hobby; eating‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..  and producing music. üßê",
      "University followed after failing horribly at the technical wizardry that was not foreseen, blagging himself 2 (yeh I can't believe it either) degrees in music production. This was to be his foundation on which to start a new career as a teacher. However, as life does circumstances changed and the balding 30 something needed to go back to doing some proper work and pack in this silly dream he had, had. ",
      "These days the old, fat, bald DJ has managed to blag a new gig with the wonderful people at Trip The Light Fantastic reigniting his Hard House loins and reminding him of slimmer, hairier times when you could be lost in the banging music with wonderful people on the dance floor thinking to yourself ‚Äúman I'm in a mess where is everyone?‚Äù.",

      'I started my DJ career in my bedroom. I got my first break at a small event in Kidderminster. My style has always stayed true to UK Hardcore, Freeform, Powerstomp, Gabba, in this order, even throwing in some Happy Hardcore for good measure üòõ.',
      "I have had Residencies at club nights such as, 'Xtream Energy' where I played and helped organise the 'Pre-Parties' and 'After parties' for 'HTID' for 10 years, alongside the 'Awesome' promoter 'Wilfee C ' and 'Tony2pills'.",
      'I became resident DJ for Random Xcitement, for Mr. MC Smilez and following this wicked achievement.',

      'I played Hardcore regularly at B2t for Strange Dave. I have played regularly at Rave to Raise, raising money for a great cancer charity.',
      "Since my early DJ days to the current more modern era of underground dance music, I have decided to become more versatile and explore my turntablism skills by playing other genre's such as, Psytrance, Trance, Hard House and Drum N Bass, which I love.",
      "Now with the opportunity to work alongside the wicked TTLF group it is time to see what 'Djing' has for me, for reading.",
