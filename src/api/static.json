        "He discovered 'Hard House' not by mistake but by an opportunity presenting itself to him and the universe gracing him with the sound that ultimately would never leave his side. From the age of 16, Jonni, had purchased his first pair of turntables. He had discovered pioneers within the industry that set him off on a path of self-discovery. At the age of 17 he experienced great loss through suicide and cancer, and with this loss he leaned on 'Hard House' to move forward with his life, and it then began to create opportunities within his adolescent life, that would change his life forever.",
        "With events such as Sundissential, Polysexual, Godskitchen, Insomniacz and Progress from 2000, this propelled him forward to wanting to influence future generations through having these experiences. This led him onto attaining regular residency spots at events across the UK and Europe.",
        "The Passion and drive instilled through this musical influence in his life has led him to starting his own brand, and further his production skills.",
        "The vision is simple, to share my passion and love for electronic dance music to bring people together, and to create a unique sound and long-lasting memories."

        "From there Josh soon began his own monthly night called 'Satisfaction' which ran up until 2003. Josh then decided it was time to take his DJ skills to the wider international audience and secured a residency in 'STAR BEACH', Malia Greece, before moving to Leeds in the same year.",
        "Josh currently lives back in Coventry and up until recently has been on pirate radio stations all across the Midlands but is hungry to bring back the days when he played at huge 'hard house' party's such as Sundissential North, B2t, Fidget and Crazy Daisy's to name but a few!",

        "Sundissential then became the norm...and it defined him!  In 2002 he began dj'ing and whilst serving away mastered his craft. In 2004 he started to poke into the Birmingham based circuit and featured in afters parties such as Shaft & Shine.",
        "The most notable and probably greatest achievement was playing alongside artists such as 12 inch thumpers, Ian M, Rafferty & Kershaw for Sundissential vs Afters!",
        "The years that followed were littered with private and personal gigs in Germany mainly, but the love for the sound never faltered!",

        "Born in the 80s raised in the 90s by modest folk from Birmingham, FiL-EP began his love affair with dance music when his family pulled together enough sheckles to buy the poor young boy a copy of the Prodigy's Experience album. After listening to this constantly day and night, at full blast and to the annoyance of everyone, there was no surprise he developed a taste for Hard House and Hard Dance in general.",
        "In the early noughties raving hard on the Sundissential dance floor, giving big sweaty hugs to everyone 😉 he realised the one thing missing in his life was a set of decks. After spending many years perfecting some skill he managed to blag a gig on the pirate (at the time) radio station Mix FM with Birmingham based legends like DJ Wisk and Tony Moretti. FiL-EP had moved on from Hard House and Hard Dance by this time preferring Garage House, Deep House and Drum and Bass. ",
        "After a year of spinning tracks on Mix FM the young DJ decided to dabble in promoting putting events (not always music related) on at various venues including Subway City Birmingham this was too much work and he couldn't be arsed with it so he lost interest and decided to try a new hobby; eating……………..  and producing music. 🧐",
        "University followed after failing horribly at the technical wizardry that was not foreseen, blagging himself 2 (yeh I can't believe it either) degrees in music production. This was to be his foundation on which to start a new career as a teacher. However, as life does circumstances changed and the balding 30 something needed to go back to doing some proper work and pack in this silly dream he had, had. ",
        "These days the old, fat, bald DJ has managed to blag a new gig with the wonderful people at Trip The Light Fantastic reigniting his Hard House loins and reminding him of slimmer, hairier times when you could be lost in the banging music with wonderful people on the dance floor thinking to yourself “man I'm in a mess where is everyone?”."

Going to various local nightclubs in Chesterfield for a couple of years until I discovered the ultimate club in the country at the time, the legendary Gatecrasher in Sheffield when I was 18.",
